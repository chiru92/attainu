        <h2 id="news">Travel Tips For Himachal Pradesh: 11 Things You Need To Know Before Visiting This Paradise In 2019</h2>
        <p>
            Whether you’re traveling with friends, family, or alone, TravelTriangle has compiled these travel tips for Himachal Pradesh
            so that you can make your journey smooth and safe along the way. Make sure you keep in mind all these things to carry while
            traveling to Manali or any other hill station in Himachal.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip 1: Tour Documents</h3>
        <p>
            For every hassle-free Himachal Pradesh trip plan, the tour confirmation voucher in printed format is a must for all travelers.
            It is needed for check-in at the hotels and for the Cab and driver details. Make sure to carry a detailed itinerary in printed
            format as it has proven to be one of the best travel tips for Himachal Pradesh. It is the most important part of the Himachal
            Pradesh travel plan. The tour will commence as per the itinerary provided. Always read the cost included section carefully.
            Anything not mentioned in the itinerary is considered excluded.
        </p>

        <h3>Tip 2: Weather Conditions</h3>
        <p>
            Most areas of Bilaspur, Una, Solan, Sirmour, Hamirpur, and Kangra are largely warm to hot in summer (25 degrees to 15 degrees),
            and mild to pleasant in winter (15 degree to 5 degrees). The district of Chamba, Kinnaur, Kullu, Shimla and Lahaul and Spiti
            are mild to pleasant (15 degree to 5 degree) in summer and cold in winter (10 degree to -5 Degree).
        </p>
        <p>
            Pack your clothing depending on your location and the month of travel. For summers, full sleeves t-shirts to sweatshirts
            should be carried but for winters, heavy woollen clothing is recommended because when you plan a trip to Himachal Pradesh
            during the winter season, a couple of layers might never be enough. So, if you’re looking for the right clothes to wear in
            Manali or other hill stations, keep this point in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Temperature in hills may change any moment, therefore, apart from the regular clothes you carry, a windcheater is a must. For
            example, at Shimla, you’ll be snowbound in the winter season and the place becomes quite breezy. For this, a windcheater is
            one of the things to carry for Shimla trip without fail.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to visit areas with heavy snowfall, you may rent gumboots from roadside vendors available on your way. Hotel staff
            and your driver will be able to guide you for the same.
        </p>

        <h3>Tip 3: Identity Proofs</h3>
        <p>
            Government issued identity proofs need to be shown at the hotel or resort before check-in. Make a note of the number of proofs
            you’re carrying in your travel guide book and always carry them with yourself while traveling. Keep a digital copy of your
            documents in your mobile devices. This is one of the most important travel tips for Himachal Pradesh which will help you in
            case of loss or emergency. In fact, a lot many customised options of “plan my trip to Himachal Pradesh” on the online travel
            portals ask for identity proofs first.
        </p>

        <h3>Tip 4: Hotel Reviews</h3>
        <p>
            Please check the Hotel amenities and ratings before booking the hotel. If you may need add-ons like heater, extra beds, blankets,
            room refreshments and more, request your travel agent to customize your package before making the payments. If you are traveling
            with children or the elderly, ask your agent to book a hotel closer to the mall roads/ lower altitudes. If you may wish to change
            your accommodation, the cancellation charges will have to be borne by the traveler.
        </p>

        <h3>Tip 5: Emergency Numbers</h3>
        <p>
            The list of travel tips for Himachal Pradesh is incomplete without making a note of the emergency numbers. Always keep the emergency
            contacts of the place you are visiting and your family members handy, especially if you’re going on a Himachal road trip.
            Always save the details of your accommodation in your mobile devices and share the information with your family members. Here’s
            a list of quick contacts for your reference.

        <h3>Tip 6: Health Precautions</h3>
        <p>
            Avoid eating anything from the roadside vendors and too small restaurants. Stick to bottled water for drinking purposes. Water and food
            (cut fruits and more) served in open may not be clean or pure and may cause stomach infections. Carry personal medication
            (Mainly Crocin, ORS/Electral, Eno, Disprin/Aspirin, Band-Aids, Thermometer, Adhesives, Alcohol-based sanitizer, Tensor Bandages,
            Antiemetics). Do not overeat while traveling to a higher altitude to avoid nausea/ vomiting. These things should be on
            the top of your list of list of things to carry while traveling to Himachal Pradesh
        </p>

        <h3>Tip 7. Behavior</h3>
        <p>
            One of the basic travel tips for Himachal Pradesh is to be courteous, adaptable, and friendly behavior. While traveling to a new
            destination always be friendly and welcoming but also maintain some distance to enjoy your own privacy. Do not be rude or
            arrogant with them but always keep a track of the cab drivers’ information. Avoid traveling or driving in late in the night due
            to low visibility and safety issues. Make sure your driver follows the itinerary as planned. Any hiring for porters should
            either be done through the hotel reference or the Department of Tourism.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip 8. Permissions</h3>
        <p>
            Some buildings and monument (Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla; Chail Palace) may require special permissions for
            photography or filming. District Administration & Tourism office will help you with the same. Also, tourists intended to take
            adventure activities are advised to inform local authorities such as SDM, Police, & Tourist office; and seek necessary
            permissions. You may need to present your id proofs to seek permissions. Call your travel agent in case you need any help
            related to getting permissions.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip 9. Planning</h3>
        <p>
            While on adventure trips, read about the location you are visiting and keep heavy woollen clothing, rubber soled shoes, gloves,
            torch, stick, food (energy bars, dry fruits, packaged food etc.), water, mosquito repellent, toilet paper, some instrument to
            lit fire (match box/ lighter etc.). Water may freeze in high altitude areas, thus, thermos is recommended.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip 10. Safety Precautions</h3>
        <p>
            This is one of the travel tips for Himachal Pradesh which one should be mindful of, for their own good. Water currents in rivers
            of Himachal Pradesh are very strong. It is highly advised to not stand near the cliff or on the bolder near the bank of the
            river or step into the river for photographs etc.
        </p>
        <h4>Must Carry:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunscreen lotion & Moisturising lotion</li>
            <li>Heavy Woollen Clothing & socks</li>
            <li>Good rubber-soled shoes</li>
            <li>Personal Medication</li>
            <li>Camera with sufficient batteries and film / memory cards</li>
            <li>Dark polarized sunglasses with retainers</li>
            <li>Id Proofs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tip 11: Cash</h3>
        <p>
            While most of the places in Himachal Pradesh are well equipped modern day amenities like an ATM, there are still a few remote
            places that lack one. And if you lucking get access to an ATM there, relying on it completely would be a wrong bet to make. So
            last but not the least, carry enough cash with you or exchange your currency in advance at an authorized foreign exchange outlet
            or bank before you drive to the remote area.
